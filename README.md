## Mathematical Modeling in GAM

- The module is designed to calculate the energy characteristics of atomic and molecular species using nitrogen as an example.
- The main classes for calculating characteristics are presented in the file "transport.py".
- The files "N.txt" and "N2.txt" contain spectroscopic data for atomic and molecular nitrogen, they are required for initialization.
- The main results and usage examples are presented in the file "main.ipynb", the export version of which is "main.html".

This project is prepared in the open source software Jupiter: https://jupyter.org/
